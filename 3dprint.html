            <P class="second__p">
            <P>3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is a process of creating three-dimensional 
                objects from a digital model by successively adding material layer by layer. 
                This technology is used in various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, 
                architecture, aerospace, and consumer goods.

            <p class="sub__text">HOW 3D PRINTING WORKS</p>
            <P class="second__p">
                The 3D printing process involves several key steps:
            	Designing a 3D Model: A digital model is created using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software or obtained from 3D scanning.
            	<br><br>Slicing the Model: The 3D model is sliced into thin horizontal layers using slicing software (e.g., Cura, Simplify3D). This software generates G-code, a set of instructions for the 3D printer.
            	<br><br>Printing: The 3D printer reads the G-code and deposits material layer by layer to create the object. This is done using different techniques depending on the printer type.
            	<br><br>Post-Processing: The printed object may require finishing processes such as cleaning, polishing, or curing.

            <p class="second__p">
                Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM): Material: Thermoplastic filaments (e.g., PLA, ABS). Process: A heated nozzle extrudes molten plastic layer by layer.
                <br><br>Stereolithography (SLA): Material: Liquid resin. Process: UV laser cures the resin layer by layer.
                <br><br>Digital Light Processing (DLP): Material: Liquid resin. Process: A digital light projector cures resin layers all at once.
                <br><br>Selective Laser Sintering (SLS): Material: Powdered materials (e.g., nylon, metal). Process: A laser sinters powdered material to form layers.
                <br><br>Binder Jetting: Material: Powder and binder. Process: A binder is selectively deposited onto a powder bed.
                <br><br>Material Jetting (MJ): Material: Liquid photopolymers. Process: A print head deposits tiny droplets of material, which are cured with UV light.
                <br><br>Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) and Selective Laser Melting (SLM): Material: Metal powders. Process: Lasers melt or sinter metal powders to create solid structures.
