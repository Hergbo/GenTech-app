            <p class="sub__text">TYPES OF AI</p>
            <p class="second__p">
                Narrow AI (Weak AI): Systems designed to handle a specific task (e.g., recommendation systems, chatbots).
                <br>General AI (Strong AI): Hypothetical systems that possess the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.
                <br>Artificial Superintelligence: A level of AI that surpasses human intelligence across all fields.
            </p>
            <p class="sub__text">KEY COMPONENTS OF AI</p>
            <p class="second__p">
                Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.
                <br>Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data.
                <br>Unsupervised Learning: Learning from unlabeled data.
                <br>Reinforcement Learning: Learning by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback.
                <br>Deep Learning: A subset of ML involving neural networks with many layers that can model complex patterns in data.
                <br>Natural Language Processing (NLP): The ability of AI to understand and generate human language.
                <br>Computer Vision: The ability of AI to interpret and understand visual information from the world.
                <br>Robotics: The integration of AI in robots to enable them to perform tasks autonomously.
